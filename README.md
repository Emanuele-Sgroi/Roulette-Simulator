# Roulette Simulator

This roulette simulator is created with JavaScript and CSS and it is fully functional.

Visit the [demo](https://emanuele-sgroi.github.io/Roulette-Simulator/)!!!

## DOM Manipulator

With this project, I used only DOM Manipulator in JavaScript, skipping the building process in HTML. With this I don't want to say that this is the best way. Personally I created this project for my own fun and practice, but i would love to share this with you all.


## Responsive but not fully

It is possible to use the application on mobile but it is not the best quality as I did not want to focus in this.


## Code description

As I mentioned above, this project was built almost entirely with JavaScript. The HTML code carries just a small header.
The js file is organized in functions that build and run a specific part of the game, such us "buildWheel" needed to create the spinning wheel.

I hope you can have a fun using this simulator and also feel free to copy the code for your own practice of if you need to create something similar in another project.
